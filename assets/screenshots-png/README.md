# WordPress.org Screenshot Requirements

For WordPress.org plugin submission, you need:

1. Screenshots in PNG format
2. Named sequentially: `screenshot-1.png`, `screenshot-2.png`, etc.
3. Place them in the root of your SVN assets directory

## Important Note

The readme.txt file references 3 screenshots:
1. Error message with explanation notification
2. Missing plugin shown in the plugins list with "Remove Notice" link
3. Auto-scroll feature that highlights the missing plugin

However, only one screenshot file is currently available. You need to create and add the other two screenshots to match the descriptions in the readme.txt file.

After creating all three screenshots with the proper naming convention, they should be uploaded to the WordPress.org SVN repository in the assets directory.
