# WordPress.org Banner Requirements

For WordPress.org plugin submission, you need:

1. Banner images in PNG format
2. Two sizes:
   - `banner-772x250.png` (for regular display)
   - `banner-1544x500.png` (for high-resolution/retina displays)
3. Place them in the root of your SVN assets directory

These files have been renamed from the original files to match WordPress.org's naming-convention and file format requirements.
