# WordPress.org Icon Requirements

For WordPress.org plugin submission, you need to:

1. Convert the SVG icon to PNG format
2. Create a 256x256 and 128x128 pixel version
3. Name them `icon-256x256.png` and `icon-128x128.png`
4. Place it in the root of your SVN assets directory

## How to Convert

You can use tools like:
- Inkscape (free, open-source)
- Adobe Illustrator
- Adobe Photoshop
- Affinity Designer
- Affinity Photo
- GIMP
- Pixelmator
- Online converters like https://svgtopng.com/

## Command Line Conversion (if you have ImageMagick installed)

```bash
convert -background none -size 256x256 assets/icon/fix-plugin-does-not-exist-notices-icon.svg assets/icon-png/icon-256x256.png
```

After creating the PNG file, it should be uploaded to the WordPress.org SVN repository in the assets directory.
