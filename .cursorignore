# Cursor ignore file
# Additional patterns beyond .gitignore for Cursor's AI context

# You can use the ! prefix to include files that are excluded by .gitignore
# Example: !important-file.log (This would include important-file.log even if *.log is in .gitignore)

# Cursor-specific temporary files
.cursor-tmp/
