# Augment ignore file
# Additional patterns beyond .gitignore that should be ignored by Augment's context engine

# You can use the ! prefix to include files that are excluded by .gitignore
# Example: !important-file.log (This would include important-file.log even if *.log is in .gitignore)

# Augment specific
.augment-cache/
