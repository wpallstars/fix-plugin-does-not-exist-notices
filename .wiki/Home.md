## About This Plugin

The "Fix 'Plugin file does not exist' Notices" plugin addresses a common issue in WordPress where removing a plugin by deleting its directory (instead of using the proper deactivation and deletion process) leaves orphaned references in the WordPress database. These orphaned references cause WordPress to display error notices in the admin area, which can be confusing and annoying for site administrators.

This plugin provides a simple, effective solution by:

1. Automatically detecting and removing these orphaned plugin references
2. Cleaning up the WordPress database to prevent the notices from appearing
3. Providing a user-friendly interface to manage the cleanup process

## Key Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies orphaned plugin references in the WordPress database
- **One-Click Cleanup**: Removes the orphaned references with a single click
- **Bulk Cleanup**: Handles multiple orphaned references at once
- **Preventive Measures**: Helps prevent future occurrences of the issue
- **Detailed Logging**: Keeps track of all cleanup actions for reference
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive controls for all users
