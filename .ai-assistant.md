## AI Workflows

Detailed workflow documentation is available in the `.ai-workflows/` directory:

- **@.ai-workflows/bug-fixing.md**: Guidelines for identifying and fixing bugs
- **@.ai-workflows/code-review.md**: Standards for reviewing code changes
- **@.ai-workflows/feature-development.md**: Process for developing new features
- **@.ai-workflows/local-env-vars.md**: Local development environment paths and URLs
- **@.ai-workflows/release-process.md**: Steps for preparing and publishing releases

## Version Management

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., 2.2.1)
  - **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
  - **MINOR**: New features, non-breaking
  - **PATCH**: Bug fixes, non-breaking

When updating version numbers, see **@.ai-workflows/release-process.md** for the complete checklist.

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention
- Feature branches: `feature/descriptive-name`
- Bug fix branches: `fix/issue-description`
- Release branches: `v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}`

### Commit Message Guidelines
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Start with a verb
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Reference issues when relevant: "Fix #123: Resolve plugin detection issue"

## Remote Repositories

The plugin is hosted on multiple repositories:
- GitHub: https://github.com/wpallstars/wp-fix-plugin-does-not-exist-notices
- Gitea: https://gitea.wpallstars.com/wpallstars/wp-fix-plugin-does-not-exist-notices
- WordPress.org: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fix-plugin-does-not-exist-notices/

Always push changes to all remotes to keep them in sync.

## Git Updater Integration

The plugin integrates with Git Updater to allow updates directly from GitHub or Gitea. Important notes:

1. Git Updater reads version information from the readme.txt file in the main branch, not from tags or releases
2. Always merge release changes to the main branch immediately after creating a tag
3. The plugin includes proper headers for Git Updater in the main plugin file

See **@.ai-workflows/release-process.md** for detailed Git Updater integration steps.

## Testing Guidelines

Before releasing:
1. Test with the latest WordPress version
2. Test with PHP 7.0+ (minimum supported version)
3. Verify all features work as expected
4. Check for any PHP warnings or notices

Local environment variables and paths are documented in **@.ai-workflows/local-env-vars.md**.
