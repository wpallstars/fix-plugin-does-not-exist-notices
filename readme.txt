Easily remove references to deleted plugins that cause "Plugin file does not exist" errors in your WordPress admin.

== Description ==

Have you ever deleted a plugin directly from the server or database and then been stuck with annoying error notifications that can't be cleared?

"The plugin folder-name/file-name.php has been deactivated due to an error: Plugin file does not exist."

This small utility plugin adds missing plugins to your WordPress plugins list and provides a "Remove Reference" link, allowing you to safely clean up invalid plugin entries with one click.

= Key Features =

* Adds missing plugins directly to your plugins list
* Provides a simple "Remove Reference" action link
* Works with both single site and multisite WordPress installations
* Includes helpful notifications explaining how to fix plugin errors
* One-click auto-scroll to find missing plugins in large sites
* Clean, user-friendly interface following WordPress design patterns

= How It Works =

When WordPress detects a plugin file that no longer exists but is still referenced in the database as active, it displays an error notice. This plugin:

1. Detects all missing plugin references in your database
2. Adds them to your plugins list with "(File Missing)" indicators
3. Provides a "Remove Reference" link to safely remove them
4. Shows clear notifications guiding you through the cleanup process

= Use Cases =

* You've accidentally deleted a plugin via FTP
* A plugin was removed by another admin but references remain
* You've migrated from another site and have leftover plugin references
* Your hosting provider removed a plugin but didn't clean the database

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `fix-plugin-does-not-exist-notices` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. No configuration needed - the plugin works automatically
4. If you have missing plugin errors, you'll immediately see them in your plugins list with "Remove Reference" links

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it safe to remove plugin references? =

Yes, this plugin only removes entries from the WordPress active_plugins option, which is safe to modify when a plugin no longer exists. It doesn't modify any other database tables or settings.

= What happens after I remove a reference? =

The plugin entry will be removed from your active plugins list, and the corresponding error notification will no longer appear after you refresh the page.

= Can I use this plugin on a multisite installation? =

Yes, the plugin works on both single sites and multisite installations. It properly handles network-activated plugins as well.

= How do I know which plugin references should be removed? =

The plugin will only show "Remove Reference" links for plugins that are listed in your database but don't actually exist in your plugins directory. These are safe to remove.

= Will this break my site? =

No. Since the plugin is only removing references to plugins that no longer exist, removing these references won't affect your site's functionality. In fact, it's cleaning up remnants that might be causing issues.

= What if I accidentally remove a reference I shouldn't have? =

If you remove a reference to a plugin that you later want to reinstall, simply install the plugin again and activate it normally.

= Do I need to keep this plugin installed and active after notices are cleared? =

Although this plugin consumes minimal disk space, and doesn't run unless you are on the /wp-admin/plugins.php page, you don't need to keep it active or installed if you don't have this notice to clear â€” but it is safe to, if you just want it as a part of your overall WordPress stack of enhancements and conveniences.
