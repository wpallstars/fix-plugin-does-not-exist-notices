# Bolt.net ignore file
# Additional patterns beyond .gitignore for Bolt.net's AI context

# You can use the ! prefix to include files that are excluded by .gitignore
# Example: !important-file.log (This would include important-file.log even if *.log is in .gitignore)

# Bolt-specific temporary files
.bolt-tmp/
